Statistic basics
================


Sample (Stichprobe):
In statistics and quantitative research methodology, a data sample is a set of data collected and/or selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.[1] The elements of a sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations.


Population (Grundgesamtheit):
In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment.[1] A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience


Construct:
Broadly speaking, constructs are the building blocks of theories, helping to explain how and why certain phenomena behave the way that they do

Variable (Merkmal):
A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. A variable may also be called a data item.

Sampling error (Stichprobenabweichung)
sampling error is incurred when the statistical characteristics of a population are estimated from a subset, or sample, of that population. Since the sample does not include all members of the population, statistics on the sample, such as means and quantiles, generally differ from the characteristics of the entire population, which are known as parameters. 

characteristic value (Merkmalauspr√§gung):

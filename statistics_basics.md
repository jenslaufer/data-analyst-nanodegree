Statistic basics
================


Sample (Stichprobe):
In statistics and quantitative research methodology, a data sample is a set of data collected and/or selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.[1] The elements of a sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations.


Population (Grundgesamtheit):
In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment.[1] A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience


Construct:
Broadly speaking, constructs are the building blocks of theories, helping to explain how and why certain phenomena behave the way that they do

Variable (Merkmal):
A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. A variable may also be called a data item.

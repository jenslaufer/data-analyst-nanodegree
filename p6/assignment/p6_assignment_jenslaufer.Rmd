## Summary


The performance of 1157 baseball players was evaluated in this data analysis.
The dataset contains 5 variables.

The goal of this project is to visualize a finding in the data with a Tableau
story.



## Data Set Exploration


The data was first analysed with a R notebook to check the data and get
a first impression.

   1. The data set was checked for problematic data. All features are available 
      and are valid. There are some players with duplicated names:
      
        - Dave Roberts 
        
        - Bobby Mitchell
        
        - Mike Brown
        
        - Dave Stapleton 
        
        - Jim Wright
        
        - Mel Stottlemyre
        
      For the second player ".1" was assigned to the name to distinguish the duplicate
      players.

   2. Additional fields
      were added, which seemed to be easier in R than with Tableau:

      
      | Field              | Description                                             |
      | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
      | HR_normalized      | Scaled value of HR  (min=0, max=1)                      |
      | avg_normalized     | Scaled value of avg (min=0, max=1)                      |
      | valuability        | Sum of HR_normalized and avg_normalized                 |
      | bmi                | Body mass index (BMI)                                   |
      | weight_bin         | Bins for weight                                         |
      | height_bin         | Bins for height                                         |
      | bmi_bin            | Bins for BMI                                            |
      
      The HR and avg field was normalized (MinMax) for the aggregation of a new 
      performance field: Valuability is the addition of the normalized
      HR and avg. It's the overall value of a player. 
      
      The field body mass index (BMI) was aggregated from weight and height.
      
      Bins were created for height, weight and BMI.

   4. The modified dataset was then exported to a new CSV, which is used within
      Tableau.

   5. A correlation matrix was then plotted with R, as it was a simple way to
      visualize the data and correlations between the features to get a first 
      impression of the data. 

   6. The data was then handed over to Tableau for the in deep explorative data 
      analysis.



## Design

### Iteration 1

#### Story Point 1

Two barchart with the names of the top homerunners and  the 
players with the highest batting average with different colors for the homeruns
and batting average are used. The size of the bars was reduced 
and a dot was added at the end of the bar.
All "chunk" from the bar charts was removed like grid line and axis labels, 
to make the visualization lightweight and clear.

#### Story Point 2

The barchart from Story Point 1 for the top homerunners was reused, 
but the color of the bars was changed.
The color is the BMI bin. As there are just 3 BMI bins the reader can easily 
understand the meaning of the color.

Below the barchart simple scatterplots for BMI, weight and height are added.
The reader can easily see where a player is on the scale of this data.

Highlight actions to let the user select (or mouseover) a player on
either the scatterplots or on the barchart are added.


#### Story Point 3

The barchart from Story Point 1 for the top 10 players with the highest
batting average was resused. For the color of the bar the handedness is used
to visualize the handedness of the players in a simple way.

Scatterplots for BMI, weight and height with highlight actions are used similiar
to story point 2.


**Feedback**

Story Point 1 

  - I miss a number for home runs/batting average at least for the first and last
  
Story Point 2/3:
 - I feel overwhelmed with 
 - I'd like to have stronger gridlines for weight/height/BMI
 - I'd like to have either all names or none, as you have   the name on top

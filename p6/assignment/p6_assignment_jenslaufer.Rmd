## Summary

The performance of 1157 baseball players was evaluated in this data analysis.
The dataset contains 5 variables.

The goal of this story is to visualize a finding in the data with Tableau.


## Data Set Exploration

The data was first cleaned with R notebook and some additional fields
were added, which seemed to be easier in R than with Tableau:


| Field              | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| HR_normalized      | Scaled value of HR  (min=0, max=1)                      |
| avg_normalized     | Scaled value of avg (min=0, max=1)                      |
| valuability        | Sum of HR_normalized and avg_normalized                 |
| valuability_normalized | Normalized value of valuability (min=0, max=1)      |
| ratio_HR_valuability | Ratio of HR on valuability                            |
| ratio_avg_valuability | Ratio of avg on valuability                          |

The data set was then checked for problematic data. All features are available 
and are valid. There seem to be some players with duplicated names.

A correlation matrix was then plotted with R, as it was a simple way to
visualize the data and correlations between the features to get a first 
impression of the data. 

The data was then handed over to Tableau for the in deep explorative data 
analysis.

## Summary

The performance of 1157 baseball players was evaluated in this data analysis.
The dataset contains 5 variables.

The goal of this project is to visualize a finding in the data with a Tableau
story.


## Data Set Exploration

The data was first analysed with a R notebook to check the data and get
a first impression.

Some additional fields
were added, which seemed to be easier in R than with Tableau and exported
to a new CSV:


| Field              | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| HR_normalized      | Scaled value of HR  (min=0, max=1)                      |
| avg_normalized     | Scaled value of avg (min=0, max=1)                      |
| valuability        | Sum of HR_normalized and avg_normalized                 |
| bmi                | Body mass index (BMI)                                   |
| weight_bin         | Bins for weight                                         |
| height_bin         | Bins for height                                         |
| bmi_bin            | Bins for BMI                                            |


The data set was then checked for problematic data. All features are available 
and are valid. There seem to be some players with duplicated names:

  - Dave Roberts 
  
  - Bobby Mitchell
  
  - Mike Brown
  
  - Dave Stapleton 
  
  - Jim Wright
  
  - Mel Stottlemyre
  
For the second player ".1" was assigned to data to distinguish the duplicate
players.

A correlation matrix was then plotted with R, as it was a simple way to
visualize the data and correlations between the features to get a first 
impression of the data. 

The data was then handed over to Tableau for the in deep explorative data 
analysis.

```{r}
data("diamonds")
```

Let's start by examining two variables in the data set.
The scatterplot is a powerful tool to help you understand
the relationship between two continuous variables.

We can quickly see if the relationship is linear or not.
In this case, we can use a variety of diamond
characteristics to help us figure out whether
the price advertised for any given diamond is 
reasonable or a rip-off.

Let's consider the price of a diamond and it's carat weight.
Create a scatterplot of price (y) vs carat weight (x).

Limit the x-axis and y-axis to omit the top 1% of values.

```{r}
quantile(diamonds$carat,probs=seq(0.01, 0.99))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds, mapping=aes(y=price,x=carat)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(quantile(diamonds,probs=seq(0.01, 0.99)))
```
